Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 3 hours / session

Introduction
------------

This class introduces fundamental issues in sculpture such as site, context, process, psychology and aesthetics of the object, and the object's relation to the body. During the semester Introduction to Sculpture will explore issues of interpretation and audience interaction. As a significant component to this class introductions to a variety of materials and techniques both traditional (wood, metal, plaster) as well as non-traditional (fabric, latex, found objects, rubber, etc.) will be emphasized.

Throughout the semester both individually, and as a class, through work produced and discussions generated from it, the meaning of such terms as '**sculpture**' '**dwelling**' '**process**' '**utility**' '**public space**' '**material**' '**private space**' '**structure**' '**nomadic**' '**permanent**' and other will be re-defined.

Whereas this is a studio-oriented class with a strong physical basis, this class will be examining these issues via readings, artist lectures, slides, videos, a field trip and other material.

Requirements
------------

A minimum of six hours per week outside class work is expected.

Three major projects will be given during the course of the semester along with smaller projects interspersed throughout. Completion of all projects is required for a passing grade, as is regular attendance.

The course will utilize readings periodically to focus and generate discussion as well as to inspire. Participation/preparation in these discussions is mandatory.

Sketchbook_:_ A book (blank, unlined, is ideal) for this class is a requirement. To be used both for artistic ideas as well as retaining technical information. When individual meetings occur it is important to have this available.

Tape measure.

Attendance on the fieldtrip to Dia Beacon / New York City.

Evaluations
-----------

Assessment and critique of your studio projects will take place in three ways:

1.  Meetings individually with professors and TA while work is being executed.
2.  A mid-point critique where work will be 75% completed and will undergo rigorous assessment from professors, teaching assistants, fellow peers, and invited artists.
3.  A final critique where comments from the first two assessments will figure into a more complete/cohesive final project.

Grading will be based on:

Safety
------

Unless otherwise mentioned come to class prepared to work.

With a myriad of different production techniques there are equally numerous ways of doing unintentional injury to yourself and others around you. The following should always be followed:

1.  Wear work clothes.
2.  Have closed toed shoes.
3.  No loose hair.
4.  No loose jewelry.
5.  Wear gloves when appropriate.
6.  Wear eye protection when appropriate.
7.  Clean up after yourself.
8.  Lift heavy objects carefully and with assistance.

If you're not sure about a procedure or equipment ask someone. (Course Instructor, TA, Woodshop Monitor)

Lab Fee
-------

The lab fee of $40 covers photocopies, and some basic material, but does not cover general materials for projects. Some material is available from the sculpture area, some for purchase, some for salvage (ask first). Others will need to be purchased directly from outside sources (list of suppliers and contacts as needed).
